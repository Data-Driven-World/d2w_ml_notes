    "In the previous notes, we only have one independent variable or one feature. In most cases of machine learning, we want to include more than one feature or we want to have a hypothesis that is not simply a straight line. For the first example, we may want to consider not only the floor area but also the storey level to predict the resale price of HDB houses. For the second example, we may want to model the relationship not as a straight line but rather as quadratic. Can we still use linear regression to do these?\n",
