    "# Linear Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You have encountered `list` as one of the built-in data types that Python support. You can use list to represent one dimensional or linear data collection where sequence and order matters. There are other kinds of linear data structures and we will explore some of them in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack is a type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last in First out) principle. Stack is common in daily life. Consider a **stack** of books. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/04/03/13/26/books-25154_960_720.png height=250 width=250></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's think about what are the operations we can do with such a structure. We can do the following:\n",
    "- We can add new book into the stack by putting it at the top. This operation is called a **push**.\n",
    "- Or you can remove a book from the stack by taking the one at the top. This operation is called a **pop**.  \n",
    "- Or you can simply look at the book at the top of the stack. This operation is called a **peek**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you cannot do, however, are the following:\n",
    "- insert a book somewhere in the middle of the stack\n",
    "- take out a book from somewhere in the middle of the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to do those two operations, you have to start by removing the books at the top first. This is why Stack is called Last in First out (LIFO). We can generalize this into an abstract concept of Stack data structure as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Programming-stack.png></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are three operations related to Stack:\n",
    "- push\n",
    "- pop\n",
    "- and peek\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a stack using Object Oriented Programming by defining a class. A Stack class has at least the following attributes and methods ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Stack\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "1. items\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "1. Push // insert\n",
    "2. Pop // remove and read\n",
    "3. Peek // only read\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue is another common data structure that we find frequently in daily life. For example, the image below shows a queue of people to Louvre Museum.\n",
    "<center><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Queue-to-the-Louvre.jpg height=250 width=250></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that Queue is different from Stack. Stack follows Last in First out principle. On the other hand, Queue follows the First in First out (FIFO) principle. The first person that enters the queue is the first person that can enter the Louvre Museum. We can abstract this as a kind of data structures shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Data_Queue.svg/405px-Data_Queue.svg.png></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues are similar to Stacks in some manners. For example, you can't access the elements in middle of the queue. This is like taking someone from the middle of the queue and let him or her enter the museum before those who are at the front of the queue. You can't also insert an element to somewhere in the middle of the queue. This is called cutting queues. No one will be happy with this. So we can only access item from the front of the queue and insert an item from the rear of the queue. These are the two operations of Queues. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `enqueue` is to put an item from the rear of the queue,\n",
    "- `dequeue` is to take an item out from the front of the queue,\n",
    "- and `peek` is similar to Stack operation which is just to read the item at the front of the queue without removing it from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such a Queue data structure must have at least the following attributes and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Queue\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "1. items\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "1. Enqueue\n",
    "2. Dequeue\n",
    "3. Peek\n",

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "How or when do we use such data structures like Stack and Queue. In this section we will illustrate two examples. The first one is an example of Stack's application and the second one is an example for Queue's application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Fix Expression Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "One application that uses Stack data structure is to evaluate a Post-Fix Expression. Our mathematical expression is normally expressed as an *infix* notation. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3 + 4 \\times 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notation, $4 \\times 2$ is evaluated first and the result is added to 3 to get the final result. In this notation, the operators are *in between* the operands. This is why it is called *infix* notation. But, this is not the only notation. We can represent the same mathematical operations using a **Post-Fix** notation. In this notation, the operators are placed before the operands justyifing its name, i.e. *postfix*. Let's write the same mathematical expression using a post-fix notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$4 2 \\times 3 +$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above notation, we can see that the operators are placed after the operands. The first two numbers are the operands. The third one is an operator for multiplication. So we will multiply the first two numbers 4 and 2. The next one is another number, i.e. 3. And the last one is an addition operator. This means that we will add 3 with the result of the multiplication of 4 and 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we use Stack to evaluate post-fix notation? The steps are written below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Post-Fix Evaluation Steps:\n",
    "1. Read the expression from left to right.\n",
    "2. If it is an operand (not an operator symbol), do the following:\n",
    "    2.1. put the operand into the stack.\n",
    "3. Otherwise (this is an operator), do the following:\n",
    "    3.1. pop out the top of the stack as the *right* operand\n",
    "    3.1. pop out the top of the stack as the *left* operand\n",
    "    3.1. evaluate the operator with the operands\n",
    "    3.1. push the result into the stack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program's Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, perhaps unknowingly, you have had an encounter with stacks just a week ago. Computer actually uses stacks in recursion! (Call stacks are an important concept in general programming too!) Let's look at this in action with the factorial fuction. factorial(3), or 3! = 3\\*2\\*1. Here's a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(x):\n",
    "  if x == 1:\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    return x * factorial(x-1)\n",

    "\n",
    "We have seen how Stack is used to evaluate post-fix notation. Now, we will work with another algorithm called Radix sort to show how Queue can be used. Radix sort is a non-comparison sorting algorithm for **integers** by grouping integers by individual digits that share the same positon and value. It utilizes 10 \"buckets\" numbered from 0-9 to sort.\n",

    "## Queue with Double Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue data structure can be implemented in different ways. The first way that comes to our mind maybe simply to use a list as its internal storage. The problem with list is that one of the Queue operation will be slow. Why is this so? Consider if we use the following code to add item into the list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def enqueue(self, item):\n",
    "    self.items.append(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, whenever we add item into the Queue, we always add it to the back. This operation takes constant time $O(1)$. However, the removal part, must be written as\n",

    "```\n",
    "def dequeue(self):\n",
    "    return self.items.pop(0)\n",

This takes $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of item in the Queue. This motivates us to think whether there is any other way of implementing Queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is yes. We can use 2 Stack data structures as Queue's internal storage. In this implementation, we have two stacks:\n",
    "- Left Stack\n",
    "- Right Stack\n",

    "\n",
    "With this implementation both enqueue and dequeue are constant time $O(1)$. Recall that it takes constant time to add an item to the end of a list and to pop an item from the end of a list. What is tricky about this implementation is that when we try to dequeue an item while the Left Stack is empty. To do this we follow the following procedures:\n",
