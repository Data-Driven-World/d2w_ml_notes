    "## What is Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)  \n",
    "\n",
    "As your program grows in complexity, you may need something more than simple built-in data types such as `str`, `int`, or `list`. For example, when you create a game, you may need an `Avatar`, or `Weapon`, etc. In these cases, it is easier to organize your code around objects. You can think of objects as your own user-defined data types. Later you will see that these objects have two main things: \n",
    "- attributes: which defines the characteristic of the object, and\n",
    "- methods: which defines what the object can do\n",
    "Attributes and methods define your object. \n",
    "\n",
    "You actually have worked with objects if you use `list` and `str` data type in your program. These are called **built-in** objects in Python. Python has provided these objects for you to use. What we will do in this section is to create your own **user-defined** objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that user-defined objects are made of other data (attributes) and computations (methods). Moreover, we will see that **any** code can be abstracted as an **object** since any computer code are made of data (attributes) and some computations (methods). In these lessons, we will see how OOP will be used for both creating user-defined data type as well as for abstracting the whole program. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you want to create a computer game with a Robot Turtle as its character. In this case, you may want to define a new data type called `RobotTurtle`.  `RobotTurtle` will have the **attributes** `speed` and `name`. Attributes describes the object and its properties. It is usually a *noun* and it is defined as a kind of variable within the object. On the other hand a Robot Turtle can `move`. So the data type `RobotTurtle` would have a **method** called `move`. Methods are a kind of functions which apply to our user-defined data type. A method describes what the object can do and so it is usually a *verb*. In order to create our user-defined objects, we have to do the following:\n",
    "1. Define a class, which defines the object with its attributes and methods\n",
    "1. Instantiate an object, which actually creates the object\n",
    "\n",
    "The class definition tells Python about your user-defined object and how to create it. It tells Python what attributes this object has using some existing built-in data types or other defined objects. It tells Python what methods the object can do. But it is important to note that a class definition is just like a kind of contract on a piece of paper. The contract does not create the object. *Instantiation* is the step that actually creates the object in the computer's memory. We will show these two steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's start by defining our `RobotTurtle` class."

The data itself should be hidden from those outside of the object. With encapsulation, the state of the object is hidden from those outside of the object. If anyone would like to change the state of the object or enquire about the state of the object, it has to do so using some **methods**. \n",

Anyone working with the object does not need to know how the state or the data inside the object is implemented.

    "In this diagram, we see that one `RobotTurtle` can have one `Coordinate`. This is a specific kind of *association* relationship called **composition**. This means that `RobotTurtle` is composed of a `Coordinate`. When the object `RobotTurtle` is destroyed, the `Coordinate` object associated with it is also destroyed. There are other kinds of relationship which we will introduce along the way. "
