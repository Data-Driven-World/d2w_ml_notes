    "### What is Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)  \n",
    "\n",
    "As your program grows in complexity, you may need something more than simple built-in data types such as `str`, `int`, or `list`. For example, when you create a game, you may need an `Avatar`, or `Weapon`, etc. In these cases, it is easier to organize your code around objects. You can think of objects as your own user-defined data types. Later you will see that these objects have two main things: \n",
    "- properties: which defines the characteristic of the object, and\n",
    "- methods: which defines what the object can do\n",
    "Properties and methods define your object. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you want to create a computer game with a Dog as its character. In this case, you may want to define a new data type called `Dog`.  \n",
    "`Dog` will have the **attributes** `dog_breed`, `weight`, and `name`. A real dog can `bark`, so the data type `Dog` would have the **methods** `bark` and `big_bark`. Methods are a kind of functions which apply to our user-defined data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with objects, you need to do the following:\n",
    "1. Define a class, which defines the object\n",
    "1. Instantiate an object, which actually creates the object\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python's code below shows how to do this for `Dog`."
