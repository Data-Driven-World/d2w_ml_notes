    "* if it is the recursive case, the computation time is $T(n) = O(1) + T(n-1)$. The constant time comes from the addition operation which is the *combine* step. On the other hand, this computation time contains $T(n-1)$ due to the recursive call for $n-1$ elements array. \n",

That recursive call is when the input array is $n-1$ elements. The computation time when $n-1$ can be explanded as another $c$ plus $T(n-2)$. We can continue doing this until we are left only with one element, which is shown on the figure on the right with $T(1)$. The tree only has one child on each node and each level has the same cost which shown by the arrown pointing to the right. We can show that there are $n$ levels in the three for $n$ elements of input in the original call. \n",
