    "# Sorting Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to practice your programming skills is by writing actual code. One of the common computation is to sort some items in some way. For example, sorting a number from smallest to biggest or names from A to Z. In this notebook, we will describe some sorting algorithms which you can implement in Python. \n",

    "Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. We will be following the PCDIT framework (**P**roblem statement, Test **C**ases, **D**esign of Algorithm, **I**mplementation, and **T**esting) in describing the steps of these algorithms. \n",

    "* The number of *inner* iteration is the $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the list. This is because the inner iteration compares a pair. So if there is $n$ elements, there will be $n-1$ pairs to compare. \n",

This means that the input list is modified and the sorted list exists in the object pointed by the input list. The advantage of this is that the list need not be duplicated and the memory is saved as we deal only with one list. \n",
