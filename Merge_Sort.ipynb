    "The previous example of summing an array gives a simple example of divide-and-conquer approach as an alternative to *iterative* solution. We also showed another problem which is easier to solve recursively as in the problem of Tower of Hanoi. Now, we will give another example which is intuitively recursive, merge sort algorithm.\n",

The idea of merge sort is split the input sequence into two parts (*divide*), and call merge sort recursively on each parts (*conquer*). After the two parts are sorted, it is then combined using *merge* step (*combine*). \n",

    "As shown in the previous section, we can divide Merge sort into two algorithm. The first algorithm is the main steps that contains the recursive calls. The second algorithm is the *merge* steps. We will discuss both algorithms below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In designing the main steps, we identify the recursive case and the base case. In our case, the base case is when the array contains only one element. In this case, the array is trivially sorted. Therefore, we do not need to do anything. On the other hand, when the number of element in the array is greater than one, we split the array into two, and call recursively the same steps, and combine them after they are sorted. We can write the algorithm in this way.\n",

    "* Then we calculate the middle point to split the array, i.e. $q = (p+r)/2$. \n",

If the number in the left array is smaller than that number is placed into the sorted array (Step 8.1.1) and the arrow moves to the next number (Step 8.1.2).
