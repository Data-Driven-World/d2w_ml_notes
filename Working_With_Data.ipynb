    "\n",
    "In the previous weeks we have discussed how various computation can be done. We begin by discussing computational complexity and divide and conquer strategy through recursion. We then discusses how data can have computation associated with it through object oriented programming. We discussed several data structures and algorithms associated with various problems. We then end up with offering a different perspective by looking at computation as a state machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second half of the course, we will look into how computation can learn from data in order to make a new computation. This new computation is often called a **prediction**. In these lessons, we focus on what is called as **supervised machine learning**. The word supervised machine learning indicates that the computer learns from some existing data on how to compute the prediction. An example of this would be given some images labelled as \"cat\" and \"not a cat\", the computer can learn to predict (or to compute) whether any a new image given to it is a cat or not a cat. \n",

    "Another example would be given a some data of housing prices in Singapore with the year of sale, area, number of rooms, and its floor hight, the computer can predict the price of another house. One other example would be given data of breast cancer cell and its measurements, one can predict whether the cell is malignant or benight. Supervised machine learning assumes that we have some existing data **labelled** with this category \"malignant\" and \"benign\". Using this labelled data (supervised), the computer can predict the category given some new data."

    "## Reading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in machine learning would be to understand the data itself. In order to do that we need to be able to read data from some source. One common source is a text file in the form of CSV format (comma separated value). Another common format is Excel spreadsheet. The data can be from some databases or some server. Different data sources will require different ways of handling it. But in all those cases we will need to know how to read those data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose we will use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to read our data. We import the data into our Python code by typing the following code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use Pandas functions to read the data. For example, if we want to read a CSV file, we can simply type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('mydata.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of Singapore housing prices. We can get some of these data from [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/). We have downloaded the CSV file so that you can access it simply from the following [dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jz8ck0obu9u1rng/resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-jan-2017-onwards.csv?raw=1). We can use the url to the raw file to open the CSV in our Python code.\n",

    "One common pre-processing operations that we normally do in machine learning is to split the data into:\n",

    "- **test** dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of splitting the dataset is simply because we should **NOT** use the same data to verify the model which we train. Let's illustrate this using our HDB resale price dataset. We have this HDB resale price dataset with 95858 entries. In our machine learning process, we would like to use this data to do the following:\n",
    "1. Train the model using the dataset\n",
    "1. Verify the accuracy of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only have one dataset, we cannot use the same data to verify the accuracy with the ones we use to train the model. This bias would obviously create high accuracy. The analogy is like when a teacher giving exactly the same question during the exam as the ones during the practice session. \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, we should split the data into two. One set is used to train the model while the other one is used to verify the model. Coming back to the analogy of the teacher giving the exam, if the teacher has a bank of questions, he or she should separate the questions into two. Some questions can be used for practice before the exam, while the rest can be used as exam questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we illustrate this using our HDB resale price dataset, this means that we have to split the table into two. Out of 95868 entries, we will take some entries as out training dataset and leave the rest for out test dataset. The common proportion is either 70% or 80% for the training dataset and leave the other 30% or 20% for the test dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important note is that the split must be done **randomly**. This is to avoid systematic bias in the split of the dataset. For example, one may enter the data according to the flat type and so flat with smaller rooms and smaller floor area will be on the top rows and those with the larger flats will be somewhere at the end of the rows. If we do not split the data randomly, we may not have any larger flats in our training set and only use the smaller flats. Similarly it can happen with any other column such as the block or the town area. \n",

    "- **validation** dataset, which is used to evaluate the model for various parameters and to choose the optimum parameter\n",
    "- **test** dataset, which is used to evaluate the model built with the optimum parameter found previously\n",
