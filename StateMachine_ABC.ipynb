    "## Designing StateMachine Class\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, all state machine have some common characteristics. This motivates us to design an Abstract Base Class for State Machine. In designing an Abstract Base Class for state machine we try to identify what is the thing that all state machines have. We know that all state machine has a **state**. This shall be one of our attributes. We also try to figure out what all state machines *can do* in common. What are the common operations? For our design, we will create three methods that all state machines can do:\n",
    "- `start()` which is to start the state machine by applying the initial state to the current state of the machine. Before calling the `start()` method, a state machine would have no state and cannot be run.\n",
    "- `step(inp)` which takes in the current input of the machine and moves the machine to the next state in the next time step. This method returns the output of the machine at that time step.\n",
    "- `transduce(list_inp)` which takes in the list of all the inputs. This method simply calls the `start()` method and run `step()` for all the input in the list of the input argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `StateMachine` class is an Abstract Base Class. This means that some of the methods of this class are waiting for implementation in the child class. This `StateMachine` class itself should not be instantiated. Any state machine instantiation should be done from one of the child classes of `StateMachine`. Why is this so?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that every state machine has different **initial state** and different **output function** as well as **next state function**. If two state machines have the same initial state as well as the same output and next state functions, it means that the two machines are equivalent. Therefore, `StateMachine` class cannot provide the detail of what is the initial state of a state machine nor can it provide the functions for the output and the next state of a state machine. These must be defined in the child class definition. The abstract `StateMachine` class only contains those implementations that is found common for all state machines. In defining our Abstract Base Class, we can specify that any implementation of its child class must define the implementation of certain methods. This is done in Python using `@abstractmethod` decorator. In our case, we will force child classses of `StateMachine` to define a method called `get_next_values(state, inp)` where these sub classes can define the implementation of the output and next state functions. This means that this method should return two things, the output and the next state given the current state and the current input. \n",

We also specifies using `<<abstract>>` notation that it is the `get_next_values(state, inp)` that the sub class has to define. Note also that the `start_state` must be initialized by the sub-class also since each state machine may have different initial state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that `get_next_values(state, inp)` in the child class provides the implementation of both the output and the next state functions. These functions are needed by the `step(inp)` method which is inherited from `StateMachine` class to determine the output and change the current state to the next state. Let's see how we can implement this in Python."

    "Let's use the steps above and see how we come up with the implementation of `LightBoxSM`. First, we ask whether it is a state machine. Since the output not only depends on whether the button is pressed or not (input is 1 or 0) but also on how many time the button has been pressed, we are dealing with a state machine. We can see this since it is not enough for us to determine whether the light is on or off simply from knowing whether the button is pressed or not. We need to know the \"other\" information.\n",

    "Second, we ask what the state is. What is the thing we have to remember? In this case is the accumulated value. To determine the output, we not only need to know the input to the machine but also the current accumulated value in the machine. This is the state of the machine.\n",

Our job now is to fill in the \"next state\" and the \"current output\" rows.\n",

One way is to identify first what is the state. Again, the state is the thing that the machine has to remember, the information needed besides the current input in order to determine the output and the next state.\n",

Answering this question will help us to identify we need to know the accumulated value up to this point, which is the value of the current state, i.e. 35. Knowing the accumulated value 35 and the current input -5, it is straight forward to obtain the output of that time step by adding the two $output = 35 - 5 = 30$. This output is the new accumulated value in the machine and, therefore, is the information that is needed at time step 3. This is why it is set as the next state value.\n",
