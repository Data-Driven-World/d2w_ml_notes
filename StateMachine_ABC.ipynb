    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, all state machine have some common characteristics. This motivates us to design an Abstract Base Class for State Machine. In designing an Abstract Base Class for state machine we try to identify what is the thing that all state machines have. We know that all state machine has a **state**. This shall be one of our attributes. We also try to figure out what all state machines can do in common. For our design, we will create three methods that all state machines have:\n",
    "- `start()` which is to start the state machine by applying the initial state to the current state of the machine. Before calling the `start()` method, a state machine would have no state and cannot be run.\n",
    "- `step(inp)` which takes in the current input of the machine and moves the machine to the next state in the next time step. This method returns the output of the machine at that time step.\n",
    "- `transduce(list_inp)` which takes in the list of all the inputs. This method simply calls the `start()` method and run `step()` for all the input in the list of the input argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our design, `StateMachine` class is an Abstract Base Class. This means that some of the methods of this class are waiting for implementation in the child class. This class should not be instantiated. Any object instantiation of a state machine class should instantiate one of the child classes of `StateMachine`. Why is this so?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that every state machine has different **initial state** and different **output function** as well as **next state function**. If two state machines have the same initial state as well as the same output and next state functions, it means that the two machines are equivalent. Therefore, `StateMachine` class cannot provide the detail of what is the initial state of a state machine nor can it provide the functions for the output and the next state of a state machine. These must be defined in the child class definition. In defining our Abstract Base Class, we can specify that any implementation of its child class has to define such methods. This is done in Python using `@abstractmethod` decorator. We will force child classses of `StateMachine` to define a method called `get_next_values(state, inp)` where these sub classes can define the implementation of the output and next state functions. This means that this method should return two things, the output and the next state given the current state and the current input. \n",

    "In this class diagram, we identify that `StateMachine` is an abstract class which requires another sub class to implement some of its definition. We also specifies that it is the `get_next_values(state, inp)` that the sub class has to define. Note also that the `start_state` must be initialized by the sub-class as each state machine may have different initial state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that `get_next_values(state, inp)` provides the implementation of both the output and the next state functions. These functions are needed by the `step(inp)` method to determine the output and change the current state to the next state. Let's see how we can implement this in Python."
