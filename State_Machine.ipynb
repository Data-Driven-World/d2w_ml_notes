    "Let's begin by creating a simple state machine called a light box. A light box has one input which is a button. When the input is pressed, a value of integer 1 is sent to the machine. When the input is not pressed, a value of integer 0 is registered. The machine only has one single button. To turn on the light, one has to press the button one time. To turn off the light, the same button has to be pressed one more time. \n",

    "Notice that now the output is not just a function of the current input. The input is 1 for both to turn on and off the light. We have to know how many time the input is 1 to determine whether the light is on or off. If the input is 1 only one time and assuming the light is off initially, we should turn on the light. But if the input is 1 for the second time, we should turn off the light. \n",

    "How can we write a program to simulate this state machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way is to use Object Oriented Programming. In this case, the machine is an object and we try to identify, what are its attribute and its methods. In our design, we will have an attribute called `state` to remember whether the light is currently on or off. We then have a method to set the output of the state machine based on the input. Lastly, we have another method called `transduce()` that takes in an argument which is a list of the input for different time steps. We write our class definition below."

    "As we can see that all state machines must store information about their *states*. For example, the light box needs to remember whether currently it is on or off and a coke machine needs to remember whether it contains a 50 cents inside the machine or not. Moreover, every state machine must be able to determine its output and next state from the current input and the current state. This is true for both light box and coke machine. The difference is that in light box machine, its output function is the same as the next state function. On the other hand, the coke machine output function is not the same as the next state function. Regardless of these two functions, a state machine should be able to move to the next state at every time step. Since all state machines have some common property and functionality, it is possible to abstract these in OOP with an Abstract Base Class. We will show this in the next lesson."
