    "## Fixed-Size Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not have a fixed-size array data type. One of the most basic data type in Python is a `list`. However, many programming languages like C/C++ and Java have this more basic and primitive list-like data type. In these programming languages, you need to declare the size of the array and its type. For example, in C or Java, it will look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int mynumber[10];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such declaration reserves 10 spaces in the memory to store an array of `int` type. If one `int` number takes 32-bit (32 digits of 0s and 1s), then the program reserves 10 spaces of 32-bit in the memory as shown in the figure below.\n",

    "In the example that we have, `n` is 10 and so the index of the last element is $n-1=9$. You can access element using the index. For example, you can use `mynumber[0]` to access the first element and `mynumber[9]` to access the last element. In C programming language, the name of the array is also the address of the first element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once it is declared to have 10 spaces, the array cannot be extended. You need to reallocate the memory if you have more numbers than what is declared. Moreover, each element has the same data type. The consequence of this is that each element occupies the same size in the memory. Since it occupies the same size, it is easy to know where the other data are. The advantage of this way of creating an array is that it is fast and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Python does not have such fixed-size array, Numpy library implements something similar in its Numpy's array. For example, numpy array must have the same data type. The difference, however, you can extend the numpy array and you need not declare how many elements are there in the array. "

You can define a new class, say `ArrayFixedSize` that uses Numpy's array as its internal storage to \"simulate\" a fixed array in Python. So objects of `ArrayFixedSize` must be declared with its size and its data type. Moreover, you will work on create a list-like data type called `MyArrayList` that is based on `ArrayFixedSize`. In this case, `MyArrayList` works like Python's built-in list where you can append elements to the list. However, since `ArrayFixedSize` has a fixed size, you need to write some codes to create new array with bigger memory size when it is already full. \n",

If there is not enough space, we can double the size of the array as in the case of adding an element at the end. If there is enough space for one more element, then no doubling of memory is needed and we can just shift all the element to the right by one position and insert the element at the position we want it. This is illustrated in the figure below.\n",

Once there is enough space, we shift all the elements to the right and modify the value of the element at position 2 (third position). \n",

Furthermore, shifting the values by one in the worst case scenario takes $O(n)$ time and modifying the value takes constant time, i.e. $O(1)$. So we should expect such insert operation takes linear $O(n)$ complexity. \n",

Moreover, you can add new element as needed by creating a new node and point the tail to the new node and the last element's next reference to this new node. In this way, you need not reserve any empty memory space as in the fixed size array. This arrangement also allows you to have a list with any size without declaring how many elements would be in the list. \n",
