Now, let's say we have a dataset of images of various animals including some cats picture inside. First, we need to separate the dataset into training set and test set. The training set is used to build the model or to train the model. Our model for classification which we discussed in the previous lessson was called Logistic Regression. After we train the model, we would like to measure how good the model is using the **test set**. We can write a table with the result of how many data is predicted correctly and not correctly as shown below.\n",
