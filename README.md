## Preparing notes

First, setup the required libraries.

You will need to install [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html).

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You might need to give permissions to run the bash script

`chmod a+x convert_to_html.sh`

Finally, run `./convert_to_html.sh`

This should create an `outputs` directory with both the html files and the pdf. If the pdf conversion takes too long, feel free to open the html file in your browser and save accordingly.
